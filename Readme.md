The hello() function returns the name of the course
The validatePassword() function takes a password as its input and returns a boolean that indicates whether or not the password has met the requirements.
The sumUpToN() function takes an integer as its input and returns the sum of all the values up to itself.

If it doesn't work its the computer's fault :)
